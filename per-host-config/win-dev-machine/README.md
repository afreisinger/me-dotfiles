## Custom stuff not setup

### Own ConEmu setup
The Cmder setup is nice, but it needs some work for it to work for me.
It has a lot of niceties, like clink, but I do not really need the
bundled git and msys.

I should base a setup file on the standard setup, remove some tasks,
and export that setup to  a file. I could then just have some task
that added a registry setting that made ConEmu/Cmder use that config
instead of the admin-writable setting it uses as the default.
